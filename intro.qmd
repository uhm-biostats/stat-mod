# Introductory material 


Here we will introduce the data we will work with throughout this course. In the context of data we will discuss ethical issues of Indigenous data sovereignty and reproducible science. We will also review the necessary R and version control knowledge for succeeding in this course. Such knowledge will include data structures in R, data input and output, data manipulation, visualization, quarto dynamic documents, and using GitHub.
