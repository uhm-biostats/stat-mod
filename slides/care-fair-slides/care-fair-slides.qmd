## FAIR

### Findable

- digital object identifier (DOI)
- searchable (meta)data


**GBIF example**

- DOI: [10.15468/s6ctus](https://doi.org/10.15468/s6ctus){target="_blank"}
- search: [occurrences](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?occurrence_status=present){target="_blank"}

## FAIR

### Accessible

- only require open source tools to access (meta)data
- API


**GBIF example**

- [API](https://techdocs.gbif.org/en/openapi/){target="_blank"}

## FAIR

### Interoperable

- use open community standards
- (meta)data are licenced for re-use
- API


**GBIF example**

- Open community standard: [Darwin Core](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/){target="_blank"}

## FAIR {.scrollable}

### Reusable

- (meta)data are licenced for re-use
- requires robust and clear metadata


**GBIF example**

- CC0 Licence: [10.15468/s6ctus](https://doi.org/10.15468/s6ctus){target="_blank"}
- Well-organized tabular data (more on that in R refresher)

|Scientific name | Country or area | Coordinates | Event date | Occurrence status | Basis of record | Dataset | Kingdom | Phylum | Class | Order | Family | Genus | Species|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
Hyposmocoma (Hyposmocoma) kukilakila Doorenweerd, Austin & Rubinoff | United States of America | 28.7N, 15.2W | 2003 Jun 28 | Present | Material citation | Five New Species of Hawaiian Endemic Fancy Case Caterpillars from a Recently Established Forest Reserve on Maui (Cosmopterigidae: Hyposmocoma) | Animalia | Arthropoda | Insecta | Lepidoptera | Cosmopterigidae | Hyposmocoma | Hyposmocoma kukilakila |

## Let's look at data for this class

- [Hawaiʻi Climate Data Portal](https://www.hawaii.edu/climate-data-portal/climate-atlas/){target="_blank"}

## Ethics of FAIR

- Disparities in science funding access [@ma2015; @petersen2021; @chen2022; @nguyen2023; @larregue2024] 
- Replication crisis [@nosek2015; @fair; @parker2016; @filazzola2021]
- Publicly funded data [@stebbins2013; @maglia2015nsf]

## CARE

- **FAIR for whom?** FAIR for only some is not FAIR at all

::::

:::


## CARE

### Collective benefit

- Data hold potential for abundant benefits (not just money)
- Should benefit community/communities of origin


## CARE

### Authority to control

- Indigenous peoples have a right to govern Indigenous data
- Data are central to governance
- FAIR can support authority to control

## CARE

### Responsibility 

- Responsibility to engage with respect, reciprocity, and earned trust
- Commit to collaborate
- Seek mutual understanding and regard for multiple worldviews

## CARE

### Ethics

- Centering the rights and wellbeing of Indigenous peoples
- Confront power imbalances
- Recognize gravity of work


## Implementing CARE with Local Contexts

### Indigenous metadata are key for CARE

![](../../img/care/lc-concept.png)

## Implementing CARE with Local Contexts

### A researcher applies Notices and notifies communities

- Notices are metadata available to researchers to indicate potential presence of Indigenous rights and interests 
- They allow researchers to fulfill, in part, their **R**esponsibility under CARE

## Implementing CARE with Local Contexts

### A researcher applies Notices and notifies communities

- Notices do *not* articulate the actual rights, interests, protocols of Indigenous peoples
- Notices are intended to be replaced by Labels


## Implementing CARE with Local Contexts

### A community applies Labels

- Labels *do* articulate the actual rights, interests, protocols of Indigenous peoples

## Implementing CARE with Local Contexts

### What's next?

- Getting large supposedly FAIR-compliant data repositories to be CARE
    - [Local Contexts' work with GBIF](https://localcontexts.org/gbif-pilot-using-tk-and-bc-labels/)
    - Harmonize CARE metadata with existing scientific community metadata standards, e.g., @hutchins2023

![source: @hutchins2023](../../img/care/leke-data.png)

## Implementing CARE with Local Contexts

### What's next?

- Getting journals to integrate CARE metadata
    - @hutchins2023 did it, but not with full journal support

![source: @hutchins2023](img/care/leke.png)

## Implementing CARE with Local Contexts

### What's next?

- Getting journals to integrate CARE metadata
    - @hutchins2023 did it, but not with full journal support
    - CARE metadata should be right up top with FAIR badges

## CARE and FAIR for this class

Data are pseudo-FAIR compliant but not CARE (so cannot really be FAIR)

## CARE and FAIR for this class

Compromises:

- Place-based teaching and research honors Hawaiʻi
- *But:* current data options are non-CARE-complying
- We can identify ways our individual use can align with CARE
- *But:* our individual respect for CARE does not correct the larger problem
- We can collaborate to envision how these data could meet the CARE principles
- *But:* that vision may not be achievable
