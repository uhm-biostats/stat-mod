    "text": "1.1 Intorducing the data\nWe will be working with data from forest monitoring plots across the pae ʻāina Hawaiʻi as well as environmental and geophysical data measured or interpolated at these monitoring plots. The forest monitoring plot data are organized and distributed in a data resource called OpenNahele (Craven et al. 2018).\nIn this context open refers to the data being openly shared and accessible in alignment with the FAIR principles which we discuss in the next section. Nahele in ʻōlelo Hawaiʻi means, in this context, forest. The use of ʻōlelo Hawaiʻi points to the fact that the data pertain to the pae ʻāina Hawaiʻi. This naming choice could show respect and acknowledgement of the Hawaiian provenance of these data, but could also be seen as appropriation. The interpretation of the naming choice depends in part on whether the data not only comply with FAIR, but also the CARE principles, which, again, we discuss in the next section. The CARE principles mandate that Indigenous provenance and governance rights are acknowledged and respected in the stewardship of data. In the case of OpenNahele, the CARE principles are not met. While the good intentions of those distributing the data is not being questioned, we also recognize there is opportunity for making right the stewardship of these, and other, data from Hawaiʻi. We dive much deeper into this discussion in the next section on CARE and FAIR.\nThe environmental and geophysical data we will use include climate variables, information about human impact, elevation, and geologic age of substrates at the locations of the plot data. For climate variables we use the Hawaiʻi Climate Data Portal (McLean et al. 2023). Elevation, geologic age, and human impact data have been organized by the authors of the OpenNahele data set in a separate data publication (Craven 2019) and we will use those already compiled data rather than re-gather them from the primary sources. However, for the sake of completeness, the primary sources are as follows: elevation (Jarvis et al. 2008), substrate age (Sherrod et al. 2007), and human impact (Society and International Earth Science Information Network 2005).\nWhile these environmental and geophysical data meet the FAIR principles, they again are not CARE compliant. Part of our work in this course will be discussing and envisioning how data collected in Hawaiʻi can live up to the CARE principles.",

The data contain taxonomic identity and diameter at breast height (DBH) for 43,590 individual trees found across 530 plots. Figure 1.1 shows the locations of plots across the pae ʻāina.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Distribution of plot locations across the pae ʻāina Hawaiʻi. Points are semi-transparent to better show plot locations when those locations are very proximate, thus darker colors represent a higher density of plots.\n\n\n\n\n\nRows in the forest plot data represent individual trees. Therefore, some data across the columns will be duplicated, for example trees from the same plot will have the same plot ID.
