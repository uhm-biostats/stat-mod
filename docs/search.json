    "text": "Welina mai!\nThis is the course website for ZOOL 631: Intro to Statistical Modeling at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa.\nBeing in Hawaiʻi we will center this place in learning about the conceptual, practical, and broader societal aspects of analyzing data with statistical models. Centering Hawaiʻi means acknowledging what our presence here means. For each of us that meaning is probably unique. Speaking personally as me, Andy, your instructor, I am a haole settler in Hawaiʻi. From that position I adapt and shorten the Land Acknowledgement example presented by the Hawaiian Place of Learning Advancement Office: This ʻāina on which our University resides is part of the larger territory recognized by Kānaka ʻŌiwi as their ancestral grandmother, Papahānaumoku. Her majesty Queen Liliʻuokalani yielded the Hawaiian Kingdom and these territories under duress and protest to the United States to avoid the bloodshed of her people. Hawaiʻi remains illegally occupied by the United States. This acknowledgement is offered fully recognizing that acknowledgement is only a first step and insufficient by itself. This course deals deeply with the intersection of statistics and colonialism in Hawaiʻi and globally. To that end we also display the Local Contexts Open to Collaborate Notice (which we will learn more about soon).",

    "section": "Learning Goals",
    "text": "Learning Goals\nEach module contains three types of learning objectives: i) conceptual foundations, ii) applications, iii) societal contexts and ethics. Conceptual foundations will help you understand how and why we apply statistics to the real world and also help you understand and evaluate the validity of the scientific literature. Applications is where you learn how to actually make these tools work for you. Societal contexts and ethics are all too often overlooked in the teaching and practice of statistics, but ultimately statistics is a central tool in how western scientists reach conclusions about the world; we have a mandate to make sure our conclusions, and the very process we take to make those conclusions, is relevant and pono.\nWe will use the R programming language as our primary tool for doing statistics. We will focus our statistical learning on the concept of likelihood and the method of Maximum Likelihood Estimation. This is a powerful approach that unifies many seemingly disparate statistical methods from logistic regression to ANOVA to contingency analysis. Likelihood methods focus on building statistical models of how we hypothesize the world works and using data to test whether those models are supported. Unlike the toy examples and cookbook style methods we often encounter in introductory statistics courses, likelihood methods will be your friend for a wide range of challenges from the simple to the complex. We will not abandon methods you may have encountered in past classes like least squares regression or t-tests, but rather show how those emerge as special cases of the more general underlying likelihood framework.",

A code of conduct for curriculum collaborators will be available after June 2026.\nWe will create a learning environment that is safe, welcoming, and supportive of individual needs. This conduct is in part mandated by UH Mānoa policy. Beyond mandates, we seek to embrace this ethic as an imperative to make the work we do as academics, researchers, teachers, and community members more just and inclusive. We commit ourselves to not discriminating against or harassing our fellow learners based on any aspect of their identities and to celebrate differences as having individual value and collective energy for creativity and good. At the same time, we commit to acknowledging that power imbalances and differences in privilege are attached to diversity by our society and by individuals. We will seek to counter power imbalances and privilege by actively listening to one another’s experiences and meeting needs that arise from those experiences. In this course there will be active sharing of ideas and work for the purposes of peer-to-peer learning, peer review, and collaboration. Our commitment to creating a safe, welcoming, and supportive learning environment is key to this type of learning. We cannot allow bullying or condescending each other about anything, including the ideas and work we share. All learners bear responsibility to uphold this conduct, but as the instructor, Andy Rominger is ultimately responsible for fostering this learning environment through modeling this code of conduct and maintaining adherence to it. Please communicate deviations from this code of conduct to Andy. Recognizing that your instructor may himself deviate from this code of conduct, please make use of formal recourse and support options available from UH Mānoa if need arises.",

    "text": "1.1 Intorducing the data\nWe will be working with data from forest monitoring plots across the pae ʻāina Hawaiʻi as well as environmental and geophysical data measured or interpolated at these monitoring plots. The forest monitoring plot data are organized and distributed in a data resource called OpenNahele (Craven et al. 2018).\nIn this context “open” refers to the data being openly shared and accessible in alignment with the FAIR principles which we discuss in the next section. Nahele in ʻōlelo Hawaiʻi means, in this context, forest. The use of ʻōlelo Hawaiʻi points to the fact that the data pertain to the pae ʻāina Hawaiʻi. This naming choice could show respect and acknowledgement of the Hawaiian provenance of these data, but could also be seen as appropriation. The interpretation of the naming choice depends in part on whether the data not only comply with FAIR, but also the CARE principles, which, again, we discuss in the next section. The CARE principles mandate that Indigenous provenance and governance rights are acknowledged and respected in the stewardship of Indigenous data. The data in OpenNahele originate from the pae ʻāina Hawaiʻi and thus within the traditional lands of the Kanaka ʻŌiwi, making them Indigenous data. Without attribution, or any indication about ʻŌiwi protocols and rights for data collection and use, OpenNahele does not meet the CARE principles. While the good intentions of those distributing the data is not being questioned, we also recognize there is opportunity for making right the stewardship of these, and other, data from Hawaiʻi. We dive much deeper into this discussion in the next section on CARE and FAIR.\nThe environmental and geophysical data we will use include climate variables, information about human impact, elevation, and geologic age of substrates at the locations of the plot data. For climate variables we use the Hawaiʻi Climate Data Portal (McLean et al. 2023). Elevation, geologic age, and human impact data have been organized by the authors of the OpenNahele data set in a separate data publication (Craven 2019) and we will use those already compiled data rather than re-gather them from the primary sources. However, for the sake of completeness, the primary sources are as follows: elevation (Jarvis et al. 2008), substrate age (Sherrod et al. 2007), and human impact (Society & International Earth Science Information Network 2005).\nWhile these environmental and geophysical data meet the FAIR principles, they again are not CARE compliant. Part of our work in this course will be discussing and envisioning how data collected in Hawaiʻi can live up to the CARE principles.",

The author (me Andy your instructor) is not trained to understand these relationships but follows the lead of ʻŌiwi scholars and their work such as Hutchins et al. (2023) and Goldberg-Hiller & Silva (2015). Genealogical relations require deep regard and respect.\nWestern science might use the term “biocultural” for the connections between human and non-human aspects of the world. In addition to “biocultural”1 moʻokūʻauhau, there are at least two other “biocultural” dimensions to consider.\n\nLāʻau lapaʻau and ethnobotanical connections to plants\nWahi pana and different categories of wao (e.g. wao akua) along with other ʻōiwi geographies that carry specific cultural protocols and sensitivities\n\nIn regard to lāʻau lapaʻau and ethnobotany, the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum provides a Hawaiian ethnobotany database built largely on the work of esteemed ʻŌiwi scholar Isabella Aiona Abbott (1992). This database is neither CARE nor FAIR compliant (not even providing full bibliographic information to fully credit Abbott (1992)) so we will not linger on it except to compare the plant names listed as ethnobotanically significant with plant names in the data we will work with. Doing so reveals that in the data set we will work with, 88% of individual trees and 56% of unique taxa have ethnobotanical significance.\nA similar analysis of the geographic overlap of wahi pana and wao with the coordinates of plot data is not as simply completed. Different wao have specific geographic boundaries and carry different cultural protocols, knowledge held by cultural practitioners and not always interoperated with western cartography [which would allow analysis with plot data; but see Winter & Lucas (2017)]. However, there is a working assumption among some cultural and natural resource practitioners in Hawaiʻi that the wao akua corresponds roughly to high elevation, native forest areas. This is not universally agreed upon but in the current context could have utility as a heuristic. What constitutes native forest is open for debate, and any choice comes with inaccuracies. However, we could ask what percent of plots are composed of at least three quarters native trees. The answer is 70%. So perhaps 70% of plots are located in wao akua across the pae ʻāina. The wao akua is a realm with strict cultural protocols relating to its kapu status (Winter et al. 2018), protocols that were likely rarely if ever met when collecting these data.\nMany—perhaps most—wahi pana are recorded in written Hawaiian language sources (e.g. nūpepa) that are cataloged in the Papakilo Database. However, Andy is not proficient enough in the Papakilo Database nor ʻōlelo Hawaiʻi nor place names across the entire pae ʻāina to analyze plot coordinates in relation to wahi pana, at least for now. But we should assume that many plots are located in or near wahi pana.",

    "text": "1.3 Ecological questions we’ll consider\nThe flora of Hawaiʻi has been a source of inspiration, sustenance, medicine, and scientific inquiry for millennia (Abbott 1992). Kānaka ʻŌiwi produced, shared, and continue to produce the ancestral knowledge needed to understand the flora of Hawaiʻi and its connect to humans. ʻŌiwi scientists do so using ʻŌiwi methodologies (for one compilation see Thapar 2013) grounded in epistemologies that at times share parallels with western epistemologies Keawe (2008) and at other times do not (Handy & Pukui 2058). ʻŌiwi methodologies are self-evidently rigorous and deserve equal respect with western methodologies. Using ancestral knowledge and Indigenous methodologies, Kānaka ʻŌiwi sustained large populations over long periods of time with effectively zero external resource input, in contrast to the current situation in Hawaiʻi of an unsustainable population, not much larger than pre-contact ʻŌiwi populations, dependent on external inputs for 90% of our needs (Gon III et al. 2018). ʻŌiwi methodologies should be learned but this class could not possibly do that justice. Therefore this class stays within western epistemologies, not out of a sense of superiority, but of positionality.\nFrom a western perspective, forests in Hawaiʻi are shaped by a multitude of processes (Barton et al. 2021). This is not a forest ecology class, but it is a class about using statistical models to help us answer questions in ecology and evolution. So we will engage with questions and hypotheses in ecology and evolution. We will foreshadow some of our future analyses by highlighting a few interesting drivers of and processes underlying plant biodiversity in Hawaiʻi.\nTwo striking features about the flora of Hawaiʻi are 1) it is abundant with diverse and unique forms of plant life; and 2) it is highly modified by human activities, notably pervasive and numerous invasive or non-native species brought by settler colonialism. Many students may not be plant people, e kala mai, so it is worth saying that neither, really, is Andy, and the two striking features about the flora of Hawaiʻi are true for the larger biota of Hawaiʻi. While the unique physiological and demographic mechanisms underlying the flora are surely different from the fauna, the courser ecological and evolutionary processes likely share some generalities.\nOf those possible generalities, we will look into a couple—with statistical models—throughout this class:\n\nHow have ecology and evolution played out across the multi-million year chronosequence of the pae ʻāina to shape differences in biodiversity across and within islands (investigated, for example, by Gillespie 2016; Rominger et al. 2016)?\nHow have human impacts and climatic variables modulated biodiversity (investigated, for example, by Lim et al. 2021; Hutchins et al. 2023)\nCan data on human impacts and climate help us understand how invasive/non-native species occupy ecosystems (investigated, for example, by Blackburn et al. 2011; Fortini et al. 2013)",

    "text": "2.1 FAIR\nCARE and FAIR are principles that specify different but complimentary ethical considerations for the collection, management, use, and governance of data (Carroll et al. 2021). The concepts underlying CARE articulate ideas of Indigenous data sovereignty and governance that have deep historical roots (UN General Assembly 2007; Kukutai & Taylor 2016; Carroll et al. 2020; Carroll et al. 2021). The concepts in FAIR relate to the more recent idea of open and reproducible science. We will discuss FAIR first, though it is not the chronologically earlier concept nor more important, because the current articulation of CARE contends with the fact that FAIR is the emerging default for data (Carroll et al. 2021).\nFAIR (Wilkinson et al. 2016) stands for Findable, Accessible, Interpretable, and Reusable. We’ll go through what each of those mean in practice and then briefly discuss the underlying ethics.",

    "title": "2  CARE and FAIR principles",
    "section": "",
    "text": "2.1.1 Findable\nThis means data and metadata should be easy to find by both humans and computers. Data should have persistent identifiers such as a digital object identifier (DOI) and have sufficient structured information such that it is searchable. As an example, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) houses species occurrence data (think museum and herbarium specimens) and assigns DOIs to every submitted data set and every user download. That downloads have a DOI means that research using those downloaded data can reference the DOI, making the exact data underpinning the research finable. GBIF also enables searching for data by different criteria including taxonomy and geographic location.\n\n\n2.1.2 Accessible\nThis means that once found, data and metadata should be retrievable by both humans and computers. Importantly, accessible in this context means metadata are always accessible, even if raw data cannot be accessed (e.g. for ethical reasons). The method for downloading or requesting access to (meta)data should be clear and not require specialized or proprietary tools but rather standardized, open (as in open source) protocols. For example. GBIF allows humans to select data for download through a web interface and complete the download through standard HTTP protocols. GBIF also serves an application programming interface (API) which allows data to be downloaded through automated computer workflows. Other examples of repositories with accessible data are Dryad Digital Repository and Zenodo, two resources we retrieved data from for this class.\n\n\n2.1.3 Interoperable\nData and metadata should use broadly applicable, formal data standards that are themselves FAIR. It should use standardized formats that allow data to be integrated with other data sets and used with various applications. As an example, GBIF uses the Darwin Core standard which provides a shared vocabulary for occurrence-based biodiversity (meta)data, with terms like scientificName, decimalLatitude, and eventDate. These terms can be thought of as standard column names that all data should have in order to meet the Darwin Core standard. All other data that use Darwin Core, or another standard that can be transliterated to Darwin Core, can now interoperate.\n\n\n2.1.4 Reusable\nTo be refundable data must be well-described with accurate metadata, including provenance, and have clear licensing that allows for reuse. In this context provenance is taken to mean the researchers who generated the data and how they generated it. In our discussion of CARE, provenance will take on a much deeper and more accurate meaning. The Darwin Core standard enables metadata to meet the reusability standard as long as the specific licence allows reuse. GBIF, for example, requires data to be licensed under a Creative Commons license. Another metadata standard worth noting is the Ecological Metadata Language which provides additional ways of describing data that do not neatly fit within the occurrence-type data most easily described by Darwin Core.\n\n\n2.1.5 Ethics of FAIR\nGlobal and local disparities in science funding access (Ma et al. 2015; Petersen 2021; Chen et al. 2022; Nguyen et al. 2023; Larregue & Nielsen 2024) means that a small proportion of researchers have dominated the means of producing data. If data were not FAIR, researchers without access to the same funding would be further disadvantaged and their contributions to science would be further lost. FAIR also came to the scientific forefront in response to the replication crisis (Nosek et al. 2015; Wilkinson et al. 2016). It is hoped that making data open and reusable will make science more transparent and reproducible (Parker et al. 2016; Filazzola & Cahill Jr 2021). Greater transiency and reproducibility should make science less prone to the analytical errors and biases that led to the replication crisis, as well as make the scientific record quicker and easier to correct when errors do occur. Most scientific data is also publicly funded and therefore there are ethical considerations for making data broadly accessible by everyone, public included, and reusable to ensure the highest scientific return on the investment from the public (Stebbins 2013; Maglia 2015).",

    "text": "2.2 CARE\nWhile ethics are implied in FAIR, CARE intentionally addresses them head-on in the context of Indigenous peoples’ rights (UN General Assembly 2007; Carroll et al. 2020; Carroll et al. 2021). CARE is an articulation of Indigenous data sovereignty (IDSov) and Indigenous data governance (IDGov). IDSov and IDGov apply to Indigenous data. Indigenous data are any form of data (including traditional knowledge, language, physical materials, digital records, and more) in any format that originate from or impact Indigenous peoples, people, communities, nations, territories (including traditional territories now occupied by colonizers), and all their constituent pieces from natural “resources” to human bodies to cultural expression (Carroll et al. 2021).\nWhere data “originate from” is a way of saying what is the provenance of the data. We saw provenance when discussing the necessity of clearly describing data under FAIR. From a colonial perspective the provenance of data sits with the researcher extracting data. But a de-colonial perspective reveals that the provenance sits with the original knowledge holders and/or stewards of the sources (e.g. lands and waters) of knowledge. The provenance of an academic recording of ʻōlelo Hawaiʻi spoken by a mānaleo does not sit with the academic but with the speaker and more broadly with Kānaka ʻŌiwi. The provenance of an entomological collection from the Waiʻanae Mountains on Oʻahu does not sit with the collector (whose name is likely attached to each specimen) but with the ʻāina, the lāhui Hawaiʻi, and Kānaka ʻŌiwi. The distinction about provenance is important because, under western intellectual property systems, provenance and ownership are assumed to be equivalent. Who “owns” the data governs the data. IDSov and IDGov work to recenter Indigenous worldviews, rights, self-determination, and wellbeing in data stewardship, rather than western notions of property.\nWe will start to build understanding of IDSov and IDGov by defining CARE. CARE (GIDA 2019; Carroll et al. 2020) stands for Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, and Ethics. We will dive deeper into each.\n\n\n\n\n\nimage credit: Carroll et al. (2020)\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.1 Collective benefit\nData inherently hold potential for innovation, value generation, and decision making. People, communities, and nations can benefit from data. The collective benefit principle stipulates that benefits should be shared collectively and specifically that data stewardship practices must enable Indigenous peoples and people to derive benefit from Indigenous data. Benefit is sometimes—in western worldviews—reflexively equated with monetary value, but benefit takes many forms including the benefit of using data to inform governance and decision making, and generally to promote wellbeing.\n\n\n2.2.2 Authority to control\nIndigenous peoples have a right to govern how Indigenous data are collected, used, managed, and shared. This means that cultural protocols from Indigenous people(s) are prioritized in the stewardship of data. Authority to control can be enabled by FAIR principles if those principles are applied to enable Indigenous peoples to access their data and use it advance their right to self-determination.\n\n\n2.2.3 Responsibility\nThose working with Indigenous data have a responsibility to engage with respect, reciprocity, and earned trust. Respect must be given to cultural protocols and rights to self-determination. Reciprocity is about ensuring that not only the benefits derived from data can advance Indigenous peoples’ wellbeing, but the process of data collection and stewardship have embedded practices of collaboration that expand the capacity (e.g. through increased data literacy) of Indigenous peoples and people to engage with data. Reciprocity and respect are also about seeking mutual understanding of worldviews and ensuring that data and their products are communicated in a way consistent with those worldviews, including in the Indigenous language of the people of provenance. Earned trust means those working with Indigenous data embrace the responsibility of collaborating with integrity and consistently support positive relationships.\n\n\n2.2.4 Ethics\nEthics means centering the rights, wellbeing, and ethical frameworks of Indigenous Peoples in the stewardship of Indigenous data. To do so requires grappling with the ways colonialism and colonists create power imbalances, scarcities (real and constructed), and trauma. This work is not trivial, which also means ethics include honoring that work by ensuring the longevity of data and its potential to produce benefits into the future. Indicating Indigenous provenance is part of ensuring future ethical use.",

    "section": "2.3 CARE and FAIR together",
    "text": "2.3 CARE and FAIR together\nStephanie Carroll and colleagues (2021), leaders in IDSov and IDGov, point out that FAIR principles can support operationalizing CARE and vice versa. Indigenous data are all too often rendered hidden, inaccessible, not reusable, and not interoperable by colonial power imbalances and institutions (Carroll et al. 2021). Making such data FAIR is necessary in these cases to begin the process of implementing CARE. From personal experience (Andy speaking here) CARE can be perceived by some researchers in colonizer institutions to curtail the implementation of FAIR, but this is misguided. As pointed out in the articulation of CARE (GIDA 2019), Indigenous data cannot be used in good conscience without “relationships built on respect, reciprocity, trust, and mutual understanding, as defined by the Indigenous Peoples to whom those data relate” (quoting from GIDA (2019)). Thus without CARE, the R (reusable) in FAIR is invalid. Operationalizing CARE results in richer, more complete metadata, and complete metadata underpin all aspects of FAIR.\nPerceived conflicts between FAIR and CARE might be resolved by asking “FAIR for whom?” and “who gets to decide?” Who gets to decide which protocols are implemented to access and reuse data? Who can find and access the data (i.e. findable and accessible for whom)? Who decided what metadata to expose to make data findable by which search terms? With whose worldview do those search terms align? Contemplating these questions might result in the conclusion that individuals or institutions that are asked to share power—power that previously was not shared—may perceive this CAREful sharing as limiting FAIR. But CARE does not limit FAIR. Rather, colonial power imbalances make data “FAIR” for some but not all, which is not actually FAIR.",

    "section": "2.4 Implementing CARE with Local Contexts Labels and Notices",
    "text": "2.4 Implementing CARE with Local Contexts Labels and Notices\nOperationalizing CARE produces metadata. Having metadata standards is one important aspect of FAIR. The IDSov and IDGov focused organization Local Contexts offers one emerging implementation of standard CARE metadata via their Labels and Notices (Local Contexts 2025a, 2025b). Labels are used by Indigenous communities and nations to articulate their rights to and interests in Indigenous data. Notices are used by researchers and colonizer institutions to affirm the existence of Indigenous rights and interests and acknowledge that work is underway to articulate those rights and interests. Notices also indicate the readiness of researchers and colonizer institutions to fulfill their responsibilities (the R in CARE) of centering Indigenous worldviews, self-determination, wellbeing, and rights in data stewardship.\nFor metadata to be useful they need to be FAIR. To make Local Contexts Labels and Notices FAIR they are hosted on the Local Contexts Hub, an online repository. To work with these metadata, communities, researchers, and colonizer institutions must first make an account on the Hub (free for communities and researchers, paid on a subscription basis for institutions). Local Contexts Hub is structured by projects. Labels and Notices are applied to data by connecting both to a project. Projects have permanent unique identifiers and persistent URLs based on those identifiers, replicating the permanence of DOIs.\nTo understand this better we will walk through the a Local Contexts workflow from the perspective of a researcher initiated the process, because “researcher” is likely the common aspect of identity shared by those participating in this course.\n\n2.4.1 A researcher applies Notices and notifies communities\nThe Local Contexts Hub workflow for a researcher should ideally begin with co-production of research goals and data management with local communities in real life outside of the Hub. For archival data already collected (the majority of data) this likely did not occur. Within the Hub a researcher creates a project to correspond to Indigenous data they are working with. The Hub does not house the data itself, only the metadata. Then Notices are applied to the project and communities are notified via the Hub. Again, ideally, researchers and communities will already be working together because even the act of defining what data are and the geographic or other bounds that delineate one data set (and thus one Hub project) from another can be surprisingly different across different ways of knowing. But projects can still be created and Notices applied in situations where co-production has not occurred (don’t let perfect be the enemy of good).\nNotices, again, affirm the existence of Indigenous rights to and interests in specific data. A notice is three things: 1) a visual badge drawing the focus of a person engaging with Indigenous data; 2) human-readable text explaining the significance of the Notice; and 3) a machine-readable string that can be integrated into data processing and management workflows. There are multiple Notices each with unique purpose. We will focus on four that individual researchers are most likely to use.\n\n2.4.1.1 Open to Collaborate\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: this Notice is being displayed here for educational purposes\n\n\n\nThe Open to Collaborate Notice is an Engagement Notice that can be used to indicate a researcher’s or institution’s commitment to CARE principles and working collaboratively on issues of IDSov and IDGov. Engagement Notices are not applied to data, but rather are appropriate to display on, for example, research or institution websites. You might recall we use this notice on the landing page of this course website. See full information here.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.1.2 Attribution Incomplete\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: this Notice is being displayed here for educational purposes and is not attached to data\n\n\n\nThe Attribution Incomplete Notice is applied to data to indicate that attribution (including provenance and contributors) is incomplete, inaccurate, or missing. This notice indicates a work in progress toward correcting the mistake of incomplete attribution. See full information here.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.1.3 Traditional Knowledge\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: this Notice is being displayed here for educational purposes and is not attached to data\n\n\n\nThe TK Notice indicates that data representing Traditional Knowledge and related terms/concepts (Traditional Ecological Knowledge, Indigenous Knowledge, Indigenous Science) carry Indigenous rights, protocols, and responsibilities. See full information here.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.1.4 Biocultural\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: this Notice is being displayed here for educational purposes and is not attached to data\n\n\n\nThe BC Notice affirms the rights of Indigenous peoples to govern the stewardship of data generated from biological sources within their traditional lands, waters, and territories. See full information here.\n\n\nNotices, because they represent a commitment to Responsibility and CARE, are expressly not to be modified by researchers/colonizer institutions according to the Notices usage guide. Notices are also not meant to be the permanent metadata associated with Indigenous data because the Notices do not themselves articulate the rights and protocols of Indigenous peoples. That is the job for Labels.\n\n\n\n2.4.2 A community applies Labels\nTo re-iterate, this workflow is from a researcher’s perspective. Indigenous communities can also create projects connected to data without need for researchers external to their communities creating the project and applying Notices. We are using the researcher-initiated example here because we are all researchers, but not all of us may be Indigenous or authorized to speak for Indigenous communities.\nIn the researcher-initiated workflow, once Notices are applied to data via a project, an Indigenous community can then replace Notices with Labels. Unlike Notices, Labels do articulate the rights, interests, and protocols of Indigenous peoples. There are many different Labels, indeed there needs to be many to express rights, interests, and protocols. Only communities can apply Labels, they are out of the purview of researchers and colonizer institutions. It should of course be noted that researchers can belong to the community of origin for the data they work with. Such scholars may have roles in both applying Notices and applying Labels if they are given that authority by their community.\nThe Labels are organized into Traditional Knowledge (TK) and Bicultural (BC) categories, and within each category there are Provenance, Protocol, and Permission Labels. Below are example Labels from each grouping (template text is quoted directly from the hyperlinked sources).\n\n2.4.2.1 Provenance Labels\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: this Label is being displayed here for educational purposes and is not attached to data\n\n\n\nTK Attribution (TK A)\nTemplate Text\nThis Label is being used to correct historical mistakes or exclusions pertaining to this material. This is especially in relation to the names of the people involved in performing or making this work and/or correctly naming the community from which it originally derives. As a user you are being asked to also apply the correct attribution in any future use of this work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: this Label is being displayed here for educational purposes and is not attached to data\n\n\n\nBC Provenance (BC P)\nTemplate Text\nThis Label is being used to affirm an inherent interest Indigenous people have in the scientific collections and data about communities, peoples, and the biodiversity found within traditional lands, waters and territories. [Community name or authorizing party] retains the right to be named and associated with it into the future. This association reflects a significant relationship and responsibility to [the species or biological entity] and associated scientific collections and data.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2.2 Permission Labels\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: this Label is being displayed here for educational purposes and is not attached to data\n\n\n\nTK Culturally Sensitive (TK CS)\nTemplate Text\nThis Label is being used to indicate that this material has cultural and/or historical sensitivities. The Label asks for care to be taken when this material is accessed, used, and circulated, especially when materials are first returned or reunited with communities of origin. In some instances, this Label will indicate that there are specific permissions for use of this material required directly from the community itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: this Label is being displayed here for educational purposes and is not attached to data\n\n\n\nBC Consent Verified (BC CV)\nTemplate Text\nThis Label is being used to verify that [community name or authorizing party] have consent conditions in place for the use of this information, collections, data, and digital sequence information. [These can be found at ….].\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2.3 Protocol Labels\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: this Label is being displayed here for educational purposes and is not attached to data\n\n\n\nTK Non-Commercial (TK NC)\nTemplate Text\nThis material has been designated as being available for non-commercial use. You are allowed to use this material for non-commercial purposes including for research, study, or public presentation and/or online in blogs or non-commercial websites. This Label asks you to think and act with fairness and responsibility towards this material and the original custodians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: this Label is being displayed here for educational purposes and is not attached to data\n\n\n\nBC Research Use (BC R)\nTemplate Text\nThis Label is being used by [community name or authorizing body] to allow this information, collection, data, and digital sequence information (DSI) to be used for unspecified research purposes. This Label does not provide permission for commercialization activities.\n[Optional return of research results statement]\n\n\n\nAs suggested in the template texts and made explicit in the Labels usage guide, Labels are intended to be customized by communities. The above examples are not a complete accounting of Labels. As researchers, we should be familiar with all Labels (link to TK here, and BC here) so we understand their implications and can be prepared to integrate that understanding into our work.\n\n\n\n2.4.3 What’s next?\nCreating a culture of understanding and responsibility to implement CARE—via Local Contexts Labels and Notices and/or other means—is a critical next step. Without understanding, metadata cannot be properly interpreted; without a cultural norm of responsibility, CARE principles will not be adopted. As a research community we have not yet realized a culture of understanding and responsibility. As a consequence, not all visions for operationalizing CARE have been fulfilled. In particular, many large, FAIR-compliant repositories such as GBIF and NCBI do not yet implement CARE, at least not across their entire databases. But very exciting work is underway by Local Contexts, the Global Indigenous Data Alliance, and others to collaborate with these repositories. See for example Local Contexts’ work with GBIF. IDSov and IDGov organizations such as the Native BioData Consortium have also produced new repositories with CARE built-in from the foundation as alternatives to existing repositories that are not CARE-compliant. There is also active innovation on how to harmonize CARE metadata with existing scientific community metadata standards, including this Local Contexts and Darwin Core example from Hutchins et al. (2023).\n\n\n\nsource: Hutchins et al. (2023)\n\n\nAnother goal is for journals to clearly indicate CARE metadata. Journals are adopting visible badges relating to FAIR (Kidwell et al. 2016), but not to CARE. For example this paper (Lim et al. 2021) based on data from Hawaiʻi prominently displays an “Open Data Badge” above the title, defining the badge later in the article.\n\n\n\nsource: Lim et al. (2021)\n\n\nAnother article centering CARE practices in a closely related journal using the same publishing platform, including overlapping authors, using data from within the same mokupuni, is not able to display Local Contexts Notices on equal footing with FAIR-related badges. Instead, Notices are displayed in data figures (the best solution available). But if Labels were to replace these Notices, the static figure would not reflect that update, whereas dynamic badges rendered by the journal itself would be able to.\n\n\n\nsource: Hutchins et al. (2023)\n\n\nThe article by Leke Hutchins and colleagues (2023) also does not earn an Open Data Badge despite metadata conforming to open standards and residing in BOLD, a FAIR repository, and the data itself residing in the Native BioData Consortium and reusable within conditions mandated by CARE.\nHawaiʻi contains a multitude of active work involving IDSov and IDGov. Among many examples, see the Paoakalani Declaration (2021), the Huamakahikina Declaration (2021), the Kūlana Noiʻi, work by the Ahupauʻa Accelerator Initiative (see “Information and Data Management, Storage, and Sharing” in their Ahupuaʻa Action Agenda), and work and advocacy by Rosie ʻAnolani Alegado (e.g. here) among many more. Among these efforts and initiatives is the critical work of organizing communities to identify authorized representatives and create decision making structures so that Labels (or another articulation of CARE metadata) can be applied to data. Currently (as of December 2025) such authorized bodies may not exist for most data stewardship scenarios, for example the data in Hutchins et al. (2023).\nThe work of advancing IDSov and IDGov in Hawaiʻi is rooted in correcting and healing the violence against and violations of human rights and Indigenous rights perpetrated against the Kanaka1 ʻŌiwi by European and American colonizers from first European contact, through the US-backed illegal overthrow, through illegal US annexation, to the present. Settler colonialism is why there is an absence of authorized bodies to articulate Indigenous rights and interests in data, let alone other aspects of wellbeing and self-determination. The research apparatus, including the University of Hawaiʻi, and scientific racism were and remain integral parts of Euro-American settler colonialism (Trask 1993; Kauai & Balutski 2024). Therefore, academic research in Hawaiʻi holds a distinct kuleana to confront and correct continued colonial practices and kākoʻo the Kanaka ʻŌiwi right to ea and self-determination.",

FAIR compliance takes the form of:\n\nFindable: within their respective databases, metadata can be searched to located the intended data and data have DOIs or other permanent identifiers. For convenience, we use copies of these data for this class, so we will not directly engage with the databases themselves.\nAccessible: the data can be downloaded through HTTP or via API using open protocols and the data are stored in open formats\nInteroperable: metadata (see tables in the previous chapter) clearly define all data fields allowing data to be merged or integrated into other workflows\nReusable: the data are licenced under open licences allowing reuse\n\nHowever, none of the data are CARE compliant.
