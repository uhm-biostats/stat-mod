# CARE and FAIR principles 

CARE and FAIR are principles that specify different but, at times, complimentary ethical considerations for the collection, management, use, and governance of data. The concepts underlying CARE articulate ideas of Indigenous data sovereignty and governance that have deep historical roots (https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/31875/624262.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y). The concepts in FAIR relate to the more recent idea of open and reproducible science. We will discuss these principles out of order in terms of chronology and ethical weight because the current articulation of CARE contends with the fact that FAIR is the emerging default for data, the result of FAIR being relatively more amenable to the colonial enterprise. 


## FAIR

FAIR stands for **F**indable, *"A**ccessible, **I**nterpretable, and **R**eusable. We'll go through what each of those mean in practice and then briefly discuss the underlying ethics.

### Findable

This means data and metadata should be easy to find by both humans and computers. Data should have persistent identifiers such as a digital object identifier (DOI) and have sufficient structured information such that it is searchable. As an example, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) houses species occurrence data (think museum and herbarium specimens) and assigns DOIs to every submitted dataset and every user download. That downloads have a DOI means that research using those downloaded data can reference the DOI, making the exact data underpinning the research finable. GBIF also enables searching for data by different criteria including taxonomy and geographic location.

### Accessible

This means that once found, data and metadata should be retrievable by both humans and computers. The method for downloading or requesting access to the (meta)data should be clear and not require specialized or proprietary tools but rather standardized, open (as in open source) protocols. For example. GBIF allows humans to select data for download through a web interface and complete the download through standard HTTP protocols. GBIF also serves an application programming interface (API) which allows data to be downloaded through automated computer workflows. Other examples of repositories with accessible data are Dryad Digital Repository and Zenodo, two resources we retrieved data from for this class.

### Interoperable

Data and metadata should use broadly applicable, formal data standards that are themselves FAIR. It should use standardized formats that allow data to be integrated with other datasets and used with various applications. As an example, GBIF uses the Darwin Core standard which provides a shared vocabulary for occurrence-based biodiversity (meta)data, with terms like `scientificName`, `decimalLatitude`, and `eventDate`. These terms can be thought of as standard column names that all data should have in order to meet the Darwin Core standard. All other data that use Darwin Core, or another standard that can be transliterated to Darwin Core, can now interoperate. 

### Reusable

To be refundable data must be well-described with accurate metadata, including provence, and have clear licensing that allows for reuse. I'm this context provence is taken to mean the researchers who generated the data and how they generated it. In our discussion of CARE, provenance will take on a much deeper and more accurate meaning. The Darwin Core standard enables metadata to meet the reusability standard as long as the specific licence allows reuse. GBIF, for example, requires data to be licensed under a Creative Commons license. Another metadata standard worth noting is the Ecological Metadata Language which provides additional ways of describing data that do not neatly fit within the occurrence-type data most easily described by Darwin Core.


### Ethics of FAIR

Global and local disparities in funding access means that a small proportion of researchers have dominated the means of producing data. If data were not FAIR, researchers without access to the same funding would be further disadvantaged and their contributions to science would be further lost. FAIR also came to the scientific forefront very much in response to the replication crisis. It is hoped that making data open and reusable will make science more transparent and reproducible. Greater transiency and reproducibility should make science less prone to the analytical errors and biases that led to the replication crisis, as well as make the scientific record quicker and easier to correct when errors do occur. Much of scientific data production is also publicly funded and therefore there are ethical considerations for making data broadly accessible by everyone, public included, and reusable to ensure the highest scientific return on the investment from the public.
